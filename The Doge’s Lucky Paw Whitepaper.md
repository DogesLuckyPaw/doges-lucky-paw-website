### **The Doge’s Lucky Paw Whitepaper**

A Community-Driven Digital Asset

**Document Version:** 1.0 **Release Date:** August 1, 2025

**1\. Introduction** The cryptocurrency market is an ever-evolving landscape, driven by both innovative technology and vibrant community culture. Meme coins, in particular, have demonstrated the power of community-led movements, turning internet culture into a new form of digital asset.

Doge’s Lucky Paw is a meme coin that embodies the spirit of its core concept: a friendly, adventurous, and lucky Shiba Inu pup who is destined for greatness. We aim to create a fun, engaging, and welcoming community for everyone, from seasoned crypto veterans to newcomers who simply love the Lucky Doge/Pup meme and the spirit of a community that wins together. This project is a true testament to decentralized community-building, launching with a 100% fair launch model with no team allocation or presale.

**2\. Vision & Mission** Our vision is to become the premier community-driven meme coin in the Solana ecosystem, uniting enthusiasts from around the world. We believe in the power of shared humor and collective action to create value. Our mission is to:

* Build a robust and active community around the adventures of our lucky pup.  
* Maintain a completely fair, transparent, and decentralized ecosystem from day one.  
* Provide a fun and accessible entry point to the crypto market.

**3\. Tokenomics** **Doge’s Lucky Paw** is a **Solana**\-based SPL token with a simple and transparent tokenomics structure designed for complete community ownership and long-term sustainability.

**Token Name:** Doge’s Lucky Paw **Ticker:** $PAW **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000,000

**Distribution (Fair Launch Model):**

* **100% of the total supply** is initially created and made available on a fair launch platform, **Pump.fun**.  
* The launch operates on a bonding curve. As the community buys the token, liquidity is automatically added, and the price gradually increases.  
* There is **no presale, no team allocation, and no private wallets**.  
* **Liquidity is created and then locked forever** upon hitting the bonding curve's market cap target, at which point the token **"graduates" to Raydium**, a leading decentralized exchange.  
* All marketing, development, and community efforts are driven and funded by the community itself, reflecting a truly decentralized project.

**4\. Roadmap** Our roadmap is a community-first approach, focusing on building a strong foundation and expanding our reach. This is a living document, and we will adapt to community feedback and market dynamics.
